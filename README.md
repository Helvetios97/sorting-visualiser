# Sorting-Visualiser

**Infos:**\
This is a sorting visualiser written with angular 9 to visualise the compared and swapped values in an unsorted array.
I have implemented a few different sorting algorithms like quick-sort or selection-sort to visually see the difference
between these sorting algorithms.

**Technology:**
* Angular 9
* Typescript
* HTML, SCSS
